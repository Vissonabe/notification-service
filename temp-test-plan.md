# Comprehensive Test Coverage Plan for Notification Service (80% Target)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a detailed testing strategy to achieve and maintain 80% code coverage for the Notification Service. Based on the current analysis, the service has very low test coverage (approximately 4.6% for statements, 0% for branches, 5.55% for functions, and 3.57% for lines). This plan provides a structured approach to systematically increase test coverage across all components.

## Current State Analysis

### Coverage Metrics (Current)

| Metric | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Gap |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|-----|
| Statements | 4.6% | 80% | 75.4% |
| Branches | 0% | 70% | 70% |
| Functions | 5.55% | 80% | 74.45% |
| Lines | 3.57% | 80% | 76.43% |

### Component Coverage Analysis

| Component | Current Coverage | Priority | Complexity |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| Notification Service | Very Low | High | High |
| Device Service | None | High | Medium |
| Retry Service | None | Medium | Medium |
| Auth Service | None | High | Low |
| Queue Services (Kafka/Redis) | None | Medium | Medium |
| Monitoring Services | None | Low | Low |

## Test Strategy

### 1. Test Pyramid Structure

We'll follow the test pyramid approach with:

- **Unit Tests (60-70% of tests)**: Test individual components in isolation
  - Focus on service methods, utility functions, and business logic
  - Use mocks for external dependencies

- **Integration Tests (20-30% of tests)**: Test interaction between components
  - Test service-to-service communication
  - Test database operations with in-memory MongoDB
  - Test message queue operations with mocked Redis/Kafka

- **E2E Tests (10% of tests)**: Test complete flows through the system
  - Test API endpoints with SuperTest
  - Validate complete notification lifecycle
  - Test authentication and authorization flows

### 2. Coverage Targets by Component

| Component | Target Coverage | Test Types |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Core Services** | 85-90% | |
| Notification Service | 90% | Unit, Integration, E2E |
| Device Service | 85% | Unit, Integration, E2E |
| Retry Service | 85% | Unit, Integration |
| **Supporting Services** | 80-85% | |
| Authentication Service | 85% | Unit, Integration, E2E |
| Queue Services | 80% | Unit, Integration |
| Monitoring Services | 75% | Unit |
| **Infrastructure** | 70-75% | |
| Database Schemas | 70% | Unit |
| DTOs & Interfaces | 70% | Unit |

## Test Implementation Details

### Key Testing Patterns

1. **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**
   - Set up test preconditions
   - Execute the code under test
   - Verify the expected outcomes

2. **Mocking External Dependencies**
   - Use Jest mock functions for external services
   - Use mongodb-memory-server for database tests
   - Mock Redis and Kafka for queue tests

3. **Test Data Factories**
   - Create reusable test data factories for notifications, devices, etc.
   - Use parameterized tests for multiple input variations

4. **Error Case Testing**
   - Test all error handling paths
   - Verify appropriate error responses
   - Test boundary conditions

### Example Test Cases

#### Notification Service Unit Tests

```typescript
// Example test for notification creation
describe('create', () => {
  it('should create a notification successfully', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const createDto = {
      recipient: { user_id: 'user123', device_ids: ['device-456'] },
      priority: 'high',
      notification: { title: 'Test', body: 'Test notification' },
      source: 'test-service',
      idempotency_key: 'test-key-123',
    };

    // Act
    const result = await service.create(createDto);

    // Assert
    expect(notificationModel.create).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
      expect.objectContaining({
        recipient: createDto.recipient,
        priority: createDto.priority,
        notification: createDto.notification,
      })
    );
    expect(result).toHaveProperty('notification_id');
    expect(result.status).toBe('accepted');
  });

  it('should handle duplicate idempotency keys', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle validation errors', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Continuous Improvement

### Monitoring and Maintaining Coverage

- Run coverage reports in CI pipeline
- Block PRs that decrease coverage below thresholds
- Regularly review and update tests for new features
- Refactor tests when improving code

### Documentation

- Document testing patterns and best practices
- Maintain up-to-date test examples
- Document mock implementations and test utilities

## Conclusion

By following this comprehensive testing plan, we will systematically increase the test coverage of the Notification Service from the current ~4% to the target of 80%. This will improve code quality, reduce bugs, and make the codebase more maintainable.
